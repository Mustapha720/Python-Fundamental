Operators
1. Arithmetic Operators

+ Addition: add two operands: x + y
- Subtraction: subtracts two operands x - y
* Multiplication: multiplies to operands x * y
/ Division (float): divides the first operand by the second x / y
// Division (floor): divides the first operand by the second x // y
% Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second x % y
** Power: returns first raised to power second operand x ** y
"""

"""
2. Comparison Operators

> Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right x > y
< Less than: True if the left operand is greater than the right x < y
== Equal to: True if both operands are equal x == y
!= Equal to: True if both operands are equal x != y
>= Greater than or equal to: True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand x >= y
<= Less than or equal to: True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand x <= y
"""

"""
3. Logical Operators

AND: True if both the operand are true x AND y
OR: True if either the operand are true x OR y
NOT: 1. True if the operand is false not x
    2. If one operand is 1 the outcome will be 0
