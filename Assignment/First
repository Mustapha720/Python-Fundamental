>>What is in-built python function? (Explain with example)
Solution:
An inbuilt Python function is a function that comes pre-defined and readily available in Python without the need for importing any external modules. These functions are part of Python's standard library and can be used directly in your code. 

Examples of inbuilt Python functions include:

1. **`print()`** - Outputs text to the console.
2. **`len()`** - Returns the length (number of items) of an object like a list, tuple, or string.
3. **`type()`** - Returns the type of an object.
4. **`input()`** - Reads a line of text from the user.
5. **`sum()`** - Returns the sum of all items in an iterable.
6. **`max()`** - Returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.
7. **`min()`** - Returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.
8. **`abs()`** - Returns the absolute value of a number.
9. **`sorted()`** - Returns a sorted list from the items in an iterable.
10. **`range()`** - Generates a sequence of numbers.

These functions are essential tools that can help simplify many common programming tasks in Python.


>>What is Concatenation? (Explain with example)
Solution:
Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings or sequences together to form a single string or sequence. In Python, concatenation is typically done using the `+` operator when working with strings.

### Example with Strings:
```python
# Concatenating two strings
str1 = "Hello, "
str2 = "World!"
result = str1 + str2

print(result)
```
**Output:**  
`Hello, World!`

Concatenation is a common operation in programming, especially when constructing strings or combining data from multiple sources.


>>What is Variable?
Solution:
A variable in programming is a symbolic name or a reference that points to a value stored in the computer's memory. Variables are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data throughout the execution of a program.
Variable serves as a container for storing values.
### Example in Python:
```python
# Declaring and assigning a value to a variable
age = 25
name = "Alice"

# Using the variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)

# Changing the value of a variable
age = 26
print("Updated Age:", age)
```
**Output:**
```
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Updated Age: 26
```

In this example:
- `age` and `name` are variables.
- `age = 25` assigns the integer value `25` to the variable `age`.
- `name = "Alice"` assigns the string `"Alice"` to the variable `name`.
- The values stored in these variables can be accessed and modified later in the program.

Variables are fundamental in programming as they allow you to store, modify, and work with data dynamically.
